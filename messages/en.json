    "about": "Motqen Association is the fruit of the Motqen program, which began its work in 1436 AH. It aims to refine the outcomes of those who wish to master their memorization of the Book of Allah from Quran memorization circles and others. The program has developed over the years to suit all beneficiaries, focusing on work evaluation through periodic and diverse evaluation tools and enabling the staff from program graduates to achieve human sustainability.",
    "about2": "Based on the pressing need we observed to expand the program's scope, which served 5,000 applicants annually, and due to the evident demand in the Quran memorization sector for such successful individual initiatives, we worked diligently, relying on Allah, to transform the program into an independent association. This association specializes in this field to achieve integration and fill the missing link alongside similar organizations. We ask Allah to make this work sincerely for His sake and a source of light for all who contributed to it."
